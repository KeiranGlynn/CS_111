# CS_111
Example repo for demonstrating git-clone on the BeagleBone


This repo was required for a CS_111 project. They requested that I clone one of my github repos to a beaglebone board, however all of my existing repositories are large in size. I don't want to unecessarily take up space on my beaglebone.
